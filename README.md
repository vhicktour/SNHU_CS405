# SNHU CS405 - Secure Coding

This repository contains coursework and projects for SNHU's CS405 Secure Coding course, including the Green Pace Secure Development Policy implementation. The course focuses on implementing secure coding practices and understanding various security vulnerabilities in software development.

## Green Pace Security Policy
This repository includes the Green Pace Developer Security Policy Guide Template, which outlines:
- Secure development practices
- Code review requirements
- Security testing procedures
- Vulnerability management
- Incident response protocols

- Visual Studio development environment
- Security analysis tools

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- C++ development tools
- Google Test framework (included in packages)

### Running the Tests
1. Open the solution file in `/M4-2/4-2 milestone/VectorTest/VectorTest.sln`
2. Build the solution in Visual Studio
3. Run the tests using the Test Explorer

### Running the Encryption Program
1. Navigate to `/M5/M5 Encryption-3/`
2. Compile `Encryption.cpp`
3. Run the executable with appropriate input file

## Security Notes
- All implementations follow Green Pace secure coding practices
- Input validation is implemented throughout
- Encryption uses standard security practices
- Memory management follows RAII principles
- Regular security audits and testing
